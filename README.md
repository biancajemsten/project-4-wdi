#### Overview
CheckIt is an application that allows users to organize an event and suggest times slots to its chosen invitees. Users invited to the event receive a push notification and can then vote on the most suitable timeslots for them. Given the votes, the organizer can then set a final time which attendees are notified of via text message.
